This project is still under development.  Currently have implemented K means 
clustering for grouping blocks of colour.

You can read more about K means clustering here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering
It's a basic clustering algorithm that will partition a data set into a known 
number of groups, aka clusters.
